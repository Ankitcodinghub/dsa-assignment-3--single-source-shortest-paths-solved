1 Introduction

In this assignment, you are to implement Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm for single-source shortest-paths to find shortest paths to different users from a given user. A user‚Äôs data is stored in struct record. The location of the user is also stored in struct record. A user can have multiple friends. All the friends of a given user U are reachable from U. All the users that are reachable from the friends of U are also reachable from U. In this assignment, for a given user, U, you need to calculate the shortest distances and shortest paths to all other users that are reachable from U.

2 Type of record

The type of a user‚Äôs record is given below.

struct record {

/* character string terminated with ‚Äô‚Äô

* maximum length is 16

*/ char name[MAX_LEN];

/* a character array of 16 characters

* not-necessarily terminated with ‚Äô‚Äô

* anywhere in the character array

*/ char uid[MAX_LEN]; int age;

/* used for verification */

int verify;

/* location */ struct location loc;

/* list of posts */ struct list_posts *posts;

/* list of friends */ struct list_records *friends;

/* needed for shortest Path */ int status; struct record *pred; double distance;

/* needed for the tree data-structure */ int height; struct record *left; struct record *right; struct record *parent;

};

The loc field of type struct location contains the location of the user. struct location contains two fields, lat and lon, that correspond to the latitude and longitude, respectively. You need to use the distance function to compute the distance between two users. The other fields that are relevant in this assignment are friends, status, pred, and distance. The friends field contains the head of the linked list that stores the references to the records corresponding to a user‚Äôs friends. The type of friends is struct list records, as shown below.

struct list_records {

struct record *record; struct list_records *next;

};

A node of type struct list records stores a reference to struct record and the reference to the next node (using the next field). This can be used to implement the list of friends. You are not allowed to change existing structures (e.g., struct record, struct list records, etc.) in your implementation. The distance and pred fields contain the shortest distance and the predecessor on a shortest path computed by your algorithm.

3 Single-source Shortest-paths

The struct record of a user U stores the references to other struct record nodes that correspond to the friends on U in a linked-list. The friends field in the struct record contains the head of this linked-list. If V is in the friends‚Äô list of U, then U is also in the friends‚Äô list of V. If two users are friends, they are connected via an undirected edge whose length is the distance between them. Two users are reachable from each other if a path exists between them. In this part, you need to compute a shortest path and the shortest distance to each user v that is reachable from a source user u. The shortest distance is the shortest distance between u and v. The shortest path is a shortest path between u and v. You need to implement Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm for single-source shortest-paths. You can use a linear scan instead of a min-heap to find a vertex with the minimum distance in your implementation. For min-heap or linear scan implementation, you can use min heap arr. min heap arr is large enough to store all vertices in the graph.

4 Library interface

In this assignment, you need to implement a library that implements all the functionalities we discussed above. The user interface for your library is given in the ‚Äúpa4.h‚Äù file. Below is a short description of these interfaces.

make friends(struct record *r1, struct record *r2): Make users r1 and r2 friends of each other if they aren‚Äôt already friends. The friends field in ‚Äústruct record‚Äù stores the head of the linked-list that stores references to friends. To make r1 a friend of the r2, insert r1 in the linkedlist r2-&gt;friends and insert r2 in the linked-list r1-&gt;friends. Return 1 if r1 and r2 are already friends before this call. Return 0 if they become friends during this call.

get friends list(struct record *r): Return the list of friends of r, i.e., r-&gt;friends.

delete friends list(struct record *r): Remove all friends from r-&gt;friends and release the corresponding memory.

5 Compilation and running the test cases

Clone the assignment repository using:

git clone https://github.com/Systems-IIITD/DSALAB.git

Implement everything in the ‚ÄúPA4/pa4.c‚Äù file. Don‚Äôt change any other files. Use printf to debug your code. Run ‚Äúmake‚Äù in the ‚ÄúPA4‚Äù folder to compile your library and the test case. There is only one test case. To run the test cases: use ‚Äú./test1 10‚Äù. It will test your program for ten records. Once your implementation works for small sizes, test and debug it for large sizes. We will test your implementation for large input sizes. So make sure to test them for large inputs as well. You are not allowed to use malloc and free directly in your library. Use allocate memory and free memory routines provided to you instead of malloc and free. In this assignment, you are allowed to allocate memory only for the linked-list nodes in the list of friends.
